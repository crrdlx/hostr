# Setup Guide for Nostr-Hive Bridge
Hostr, Nostr <--> Hive bridge: [https://github.com/crrdlx/hostr](https://github.com/crrdlx/hostr)

## What You‚Äôll Need
- A computer or server with Ubuntu. Ideally, Hostr will run 24/7, so a VPS or dedicated device (like a Raspberry Pi) is ideal. Hostr was set up using Ubuntu 24.04.
- A Hive account. See sign up at [signup.hive.io](https://signup.hive.io) for options or use a free [VIP ticket](https://crrdlx.vercel.app/hive-vip-ticket.html).
- A Nostr account. Create one at [nstart.me](https://nstart.me) or use a Nostr app like [nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja) or [iris.to](https://iris.to).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install Basic Tools
You‚Äôll need some software to run the bridge. Open a terminal (a command line window) on your Ubuntu system.

- Update your system:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
- Install Node.js (to run the bridge):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt install -y nodejs
  ```
- Install Git (to download the code):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y git
  ```
- Check versions:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  git --version
  ```
  You should see `v18` or higher for Node.js, `8` or higher for npm, and `2` or higher for Git.

### 2. Download the Hostr Bridge Code
Get the bridge code from GitHub.

- Create a folder and download:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/hostr
  cd ~/hostr
  git clone https://github.com/crrdlx/hostr.git .
  ```
- Check files:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  You should see a  `bidirectional-bridge.js`, `bidirectional-longform30023.js`, `package.json`, a license, `README.md`, and this  `SETUP.md`.


### 3. Install Dependencies
The bridge needs extra code libraries, which are listed in the `package.json` file.

- Install all required libraries:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  This automatically downloads libraries like `nostr-tools` and `@hiveio/dhive`, along with other dependencies needed for the bridge. It may take a minute.

### 4. Set Up Your Credentials
The bridge needs your Hive and Nostr account details to post for you.

- Create a `.env` file. Keep this file private, as it contains sensitive keys!
  ```bash
  nano .env
  ```
- Paste this, filling in your details:
  ```
  # Your Hive username (e.g., hostr, without @)
  HIVE_USERNAME=your_hive_username
  # Your Hive POSTING key (starts with 5 or P, found in peakd.com > Wallet > Keys > Posting Private Key). Do NOT use Active or Owner keys!
  HIVE_POSTING_KEY=your_hive_posting_key
  # Your Nostr public key (starts with npub, found in your Nostr app like nostrudel.ninja > Settings > Public Key)
  NOSTR_PUBLIC_KEY=your_nostr_public_key
  # Your Nostr private key in HEX format (NOT nsec). If you have an nsec key, convert it to HEX at nostrtool.com (Load a privkey from nsec/hex). Keep this secret!
  NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_nostr_private_key
  ```
  - **Hive Username**: Your Hive account name (e.g., `hostr`, without `@`).
  - **Hive Posting Key**: Find this in your Hive wallet (e.g., on [peakd.com](https://peakd.com) under Wallet > Keys > Posting Private Key). Starts with `5` or `P`. Use the **Posting Key** (not Active or Owner) to avoid errors.
  - **Nostr Public Key**: Starts with `npub`. Get it from your Nostr app (e.g., [nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja) Settings > Public Key).
  - **Nostr Private Key**: Needs to be in HEX format (not `nsec`). If your app gives an `nsec` key, convert it to HEX at [nostrtool.com](https://nostrtool.com) (select "Load a privkey from nsec/hex"). Keep this secret!
- Save: Press `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`.
- Secure the file:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 .env
  ```

### 5. Run the Bridge
Choose which bridge to run:
- `bidirectional-longform30023.js`: Only listens for and bridges Nostr *long-form articles* (kind 30023) to Hive, and it bridges Hive posts to Nostr. This is recommended if you post frequently on Nostr to avoid spamming Hive. "Frequently" might mean more than 3 posts per day.
- `bidirectional-bridge.js`: Listens for and bridges both  long-form articles (kind 30023) *and* short notes (kind 1) to Hive, and it bridges Hive posts to Nostr. Use this version if you post rarely on Nostr. By "rarely," that may mean 3 or fewer per day.

If unsure, start with `bidirectional-longform30023.js` to be safe. See `README.md` for details.

- Run your chosen bridge:
  ```bash
  node bidirectional-longform30023.js
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  node bidirectional-bridge.js
  ```
- You should see:
  ```
  Starting bidirectional bridge for Hive user: your_hive_username, Nostr pubkey: your_nostr_public_key
  [Bridge] üîå Connected to relay: wss://nos.lol
  ...
  [Nostr‚ÜíHive] üéß Listening for Nostr events...
  [Hive‚ÜíNostr] üîç Checking for new Hive posts...
  ```
- Test it:
  - In [nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja) or your Nostr client of choice, post a Nostr note. Use relays like `wss://nos.lol` or `wss://nostr.wine`. It should appear on Hive ([peakd.com/@your_hive_username](https://peakd.com)) shortly.
  - Post on Hive via [peakd.com](https://peakd.com) or your Hive front end of choice. It should appear on Nostr ([nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja)) shortly.
- Stop: Press `Ctrl+C`.

If tests work, stick with your chosen bridge. Just remember community posting norms on Hive. You don't want to post too often there (see the README.md).

### 6. Keep It Running
To run the bridge 24/7, use `tmux` (keeps it running even if you close the terminal).

- Install tmux:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y tmux
  ```
- Start a tmux session and start the bridge:
  ```bash
  tmux new -s hostr-bridge
  cd ~/hostr
  node bidirectional-longform30023.js
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  node bidirectional-bridge.js
  ```
- Detach (leave bridge running): Press `Ctrl+B`, then `D`.

- Check current tmux sessions:
  ```
  tmux ls
  ```
- Reconnect later:
  ```bash
  tmux a -t hostr-bridge
  ```
- Stop the bridge:
  ```bash
  tmux a -t hostr-bridge
  # Press Ctrl+C to stop
  # Press Ctrl+B, then D to detach
  ```

### Tips
- **Hive Posting**: Hive allows one post every 5 minutes. The bridge queues posts to avoid spamming. Too many Hive posts can lead to downvotes and lower reputation, so build your reputation carefully. Use `bidirectional-longform30023.js` if you post often on Nostr.
- **Nostr Relays**: The bridge uses relays like `wss://nos.lol` and `wss://nostr.wine`. Ensure your Nostr app (e.g., [nostrudel.ninja](https://nostrudel.ninja)) uses these relays for posts to be detected.
- **Security**: Never share your `.env` file or Nostr private key/Hive posting key.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - No posts on Hive? Check logs for errors (e.g., wrong Hive posting key).
  - No posts on Nostr? Verify your Nostr keys and relays in your app.
  - Restart with `node bidirectional-longform30023.js` or `node bidirectional-bridge.js` to see logs.
- **Community**: Use tags that are relevant to the content of your post. Hive frowns on tag spamming. Post sparingly (a few times per day) to respect Hive norms.

### What‚Äôs Happening?
- **Nostr to Hive**: Your Nostr notes (kind 1) and articles (kind 30023) become Hive posts with a link to Nostr.
- **Hive to Nostr**: Your Hive posts become Nostr notes with a link to Hive. Nostr-originated posts are skipped to avoid loops.
- **Safety**: The bridge prevents duplicates and respects Hive‚Äôs posting limits.

## Need Help?
- On the Hive side, reach out to @crrdlx or comment anywhere with `!HELP` or `!help` in any Hive post and describe your issue. Someone will respond.
- On the Nostr side, message crrdlx at `npub1qpdufhjpel94srm3ett2azgf49m9dp3n5nm2j0rt0l2mlmc3ux3qza082j`
- Check `README.md` for more details.

Happy bridging!
